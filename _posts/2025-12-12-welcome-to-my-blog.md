## Welcome!

Hey there! I'm excited to launch this blog where I'll be sharing my journey and insights in mobile security research, Android reverse engineering, and CTF competitions.

### What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find content covering:

- **Android Reverse Engineering**: Deep dives into Android app analysis, deobfuscation techniques, and framework detection
- **Mobile Malware Analysis**: Examining real-world mobile threats and attack patterns
- **CTF Writeups**: Solutions and approaches to mobile security challenges
- **Tool Development**: Custom tools and scripts for mobile security research
- **Research Findings**: Original security research and vulnerability analysis

### My Background

As a member of Team bi0s and a mobile security researcher, I've had the privilege of:

- Winning Black Hat MEA competitions
- Competing at DEFCON Mobile CTF
- Publishing research with IEEE
- Developing CTF challenges for major competitions

### Stay Connected

I'll be posting regularly about my latest research, CTF experiences, and technical deep-dives into Android security. Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sam_mg_) and check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sam-mg).
